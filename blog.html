            <h1> My Programming Experience </h1>
            <b>- Last year i signed up for the study HBO-ICT here at HZ University. I had planned on becoming a software
                developer for over a year at that point. I never actually did any programming before I was in my first
                year of ICT. The first few months went great, and I had a really fun time. But then the second quartile

            <b>- My whole life I have been fascinated by technology. It all started when I was a little boy, and my
                parents gifted me a Nintendo DS for my birthday. I remember being amazed by the the fact that the bottom
                screen could be used with touch controls. How could that even be possible?... <a

            <h1> Feedback on my website</h1>
            <b>- The day before we had the poster presentations, I ran into big trouble. My laptop crashed when I was
                pushing my website to GitHub. I lost half of my work from the last couple of days AND I lost my poster
                concept art. I tried to retrieve my lost files for over an hour, but nothing worked. They were gone...
