            <p> Website of an 18-year-old ICT student at
                <a href="https://hz.nl/en" target="_blank">HZ University of Applied Science</a>
            </p>
            <p> Here you will learn about me and the choices I made to lead me here.
            </p>
            <p>My goal here is to become a great software developer and master many programming languages.
                My journey at HBO-ICT actually did not start this year; it started in 2021. After finishing
                my high school I had only just turned 17 years old. You could say I was pretty clueless about in which
                direction I wanted to take my life. As a kid I was always interested in tech (especially phones and
                laptops).
                So I thought to myself: why not ICT? That has to do with computers and stuff... right? </p>
            <p> Well I quickly found
                out that coding and programming actually IS as difficult as it seems. But I didn't mind it. I kept
                on trying, struggling, failing and finding solutions. But as time went on, everything got harder. I got
                distracted easier and I lost my focus. I fell behind and lost all my motivation very quickly. So i quit.
                I told myself: there must be another study that suits me better. So I started searching. Many months of
                research
                later, I found myself back at square one: nothing peaked my interest as much as ICT did. That realisation completed
                the cycle, and brought me back here. </p>
