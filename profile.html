            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>Hi there, my name is Borna Vileta. I am 18 years old and I have
                lived in a city called Vlissingen for my entire life. Though I may look
                and sound like it, I'm actually not Dutch. My parents are from Croatia,
                and as I was raised speaking the Croatian language, and have visited the country more times
                than I can count, I consider myself Croatian rather than Dutch.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not at school I like to do lots of different things. I work in a local restaurand once or twice
                a week and I love to exersise, basketball and
                weight-lifting in particular. I also love to meet up with friends, grab something to eat and have
                a good time together. I have recently picked up the habit of reading.
            </p>
            <p>I absolutely love technology. Phones, laptops, computers, headphones, it doesn't matter. I have always
                been
                fascinated by it and often watch streams or videos about the new events of popular brands. It really
                does amazes me how fast technology has evolved over the last couple of years. I have some experience with
                HTML, CSS and Javascript. And some minimal experience with Typescript, Python and PHP.
            </p>
